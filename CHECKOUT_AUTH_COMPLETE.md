# 🎉 Checkout Authentication Integration - Complete!

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **1. Authentication Check at Checkout**
When users navigate to the checkout page, the system now:
- **Detects authentication status** automatically
- **Shows a prominent banner** prompting users to log in for a better experience
- **Allows guest checkout** with a "Continue without account" option
- **Pre-fills shipping information** for authenticated users

### **2. Authentication Prompt Banner**
A beautiful, non-intrusive banner that appears at the top of checkout:
- **Icon and clear messaging** explaining benefits of logging in
- **Two action buttons:**
  - "Se connecter" - Opens login modal
  - "Continuer sans compte" - Dismisses banner and continues as guest
- **Auto-dismisses** when user logs in

### **3. User Status Display**
For authenticated users, shows a green success banner with:
- ✅ Checkmark icon
- User's full name and email
- "Connecté en tant que..." message
- Visual confirmation of logged-in status

### **4. Pre-filled Form Data**
When authenticated:
- **Automatically fills** shipping form with user's saved information:
  - First name, last name
  - Email, phone
  - Address, city, postal code
- **Shows indicator** "Informations pré-remplies" with checkmark
- **Saves time** and reduces errors

### **5. Backend Order Creation**
Complete integration with the backend API:
- **Validates authentication** before final order submission
- **Maps payment methods** correctly:
  - card → CREDIT_CARD
  - mobile → MOBILE_PAYMENT
  - bank → BANK_TRANSFER
  - cash → CASH_ON_DELIVERY
- **Sends order data** to backend API
- **Handles responses** and errors gracefully
- **Clears cart** on successful order
- **Navigates to confirmation** with real order number

### **6. Authentication Modal Integration**
- **Opens login modal** when user tries to complete order without authentication
- **Shows toast notification** explaining login is required
- **Seamless flow** - after login, user can continue checkout
- **Modal can be triggered** from the banner or final submission

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**
1. **`src/pages/Checkout.tsx`**
   - Added `useAuth` hook
   - Added `useCreateOrder` hook
   - Added authentication state management
   - Added pre-fill logic with `useEffect`
   - Added authentication prompt banner
   - Added user status display
   - Integrated backend order creation
   - Added AuthModal component

### **Key Code Changes:**

#### **1. Authentication State:**
```typescript
const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
const createOrder = useCreateOrder();
const [showAuthModal, setShowAuthModal] = useState(false);
const [showAuthPrompt, setShowAuthPrompt] = useState(false);
```

#### **2. Pre-fill User Data:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated && user) {
    setFormData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      firstName: user.firstName || prev.firstName,
      lastName: user.lastName || prev.lastName,
      email: user.email || prev.email,
      phone: user.phone || prev.phone,
      address: user.address || prev.address,
      city: user.city || prev.city,
      postalCode: user.postalCode || prev.postalCode,
    }));
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, user]);
```

#### **3. Backend Order Creation:**
```typescript
const orderData = {
  items: items.map(item => ({
    productId: item.id,
    quantity: item.quantity,
  })),
  paymentMethod: /* mapped correctly */,
  shippingFirstName: formData.firstName,
  // ... all shipping fields
};

const response = await createOrder.mutateAsync(orderData);
```
